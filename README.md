# MCPA-proto

The MCPA code is under constant development. This repository contains scripts that are STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT and either minimally tested or completely untested. Improvements on the current release of MCPA or new features under development may appear here, but it comes with no guarantees of functionality or even safety. Buggy / hackish code may cause eye cancer. Proceed at your own risk.
